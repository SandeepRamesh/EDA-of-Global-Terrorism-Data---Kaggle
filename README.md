# EDA-of-Global-Terrorism-Data---Kaggle
This project is based on the Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Terrorism Dataset hosted in Kaggle. I have used various kinds of basic plots like MatplotLib and Seaborn to give an initial look of the data. Advanced libraries like Plotly and Folium were later used to create highly interactive plots. Graphs like Bubble Chart and Heat Map were done using Plotly . Folium was later used to create highly interactive global maps mapping the terrorist organizations and the country where they carried out their attack. To finish off the visualization, i had also used Folium's Choropleth maps to give a heat map of the world describing the number of casualties suffered across the years from 1970 to 2016.
